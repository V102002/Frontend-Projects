## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS

### What I learned

I learned the concept of making forms using JS. I learnt about using "<form>", onsubmit(), indexOf(),split() and some() and few more.
The some() tells if atleast one element in the array satisfies a condition in a callback function
Split() splits the string into an array of substring with a specified separator

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on JavaScript and understand its functions
