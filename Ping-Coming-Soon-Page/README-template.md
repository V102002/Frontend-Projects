## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS

### What I learned

I revised how email validation works without using the built-in function

### Continued development

 For this challenge, I had to revisit a previos challenge which had email validation, so I have to focus more on using JS
